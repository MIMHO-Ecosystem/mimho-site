# MIMHO Ecosystem — Official Website Repository

This repository serves as the **official public registry and source of truth** for the MIMHO Ecosystem website.

While the live website is hosted and protected via Cloudflare for performance and security reasons, this GitHub repository exists to guarantee **public transparency, historical traceability, and verifiable authenticity** of the MIMHO front-end.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intentionally public and immutable in intent. Its goals are:

- Provide a **verifiable source of truth** for the MIMHO website
- Allow third parties to independently confirm the authenticity of the project
- Preserve a **public historical record** of the ecosystem’s evolution
- Reinforce the project’s commitment to transparency and decentralization

Any changes to the live website are reflected here to ensure consistency and accountability.

## 🌐 Hosting & Infrastructure

- **Live Website:** Hosted and protected via Cloudflare  
- **Repository Role:** Public registry and transparency layer  

Cloudflare is used strictly for:
- DDoS protection
- Performance optimization
- Global availability  

It does **not** replace public verification.  
This GitHub repository remains the canonical reference.
